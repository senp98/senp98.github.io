I am currently an AI algorithm engineer at [**Unitree Robotics**](https://www.unitree.com/), where I focus on developing reliable and generalizable systems for robotic applications. I received my Ph.D. degree in the CS department from City University of Hong Kong **(CityU)**, under the supervision of [Prof. Xiaohua Jia](https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/~jia/), and my B.E. degree in CSE department from the Southern University of Science and Technology **(SUSTech)**, supervised by [Prof. Xin Yao](https://cse.sustech.edu.cn/faculty/~xiny/).
