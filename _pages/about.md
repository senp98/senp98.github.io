<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently a Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at City University of Hong Kong, under the supervision of [Prof. Xiaohua Jia](https://www.cs.cityu.edu.hk/~jia/).
Prior to joining CityU, I received my B.E. degree from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech), supervised by [Prof. Xin Yao](https://cse.sustech.edu.cn/faculty/~xiny/).
My current research interests focus on AI security and safety, as well as vision-language models (VLMs) and vision-language-action systems (VLAs) in the domain of embodied intelligence.

**\[ICML 2025\]** [CAT: Contrastive Adversarial Training for Evaluating the Robustness of Protective Perturbations in Latent Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.07225)

**Sen Peng**, Mingyue Wang, Jianfei He, Jijia Yang, Xiaohua Jia

[**Project Page**](https://github.com/senp98/CAT) | <strong><span class='show_paper_citations' data='7jRjatEAAAAJ:UebtZRa9Y70C'></span></strong>
- We propose Contrastive Adversarial Training (CAT) to evaluate protective perturbations in LDM customization, revealing their vulnerability by leveraging the latent representation distortion and demonstrating significant effectiveness across extensive experiments.
